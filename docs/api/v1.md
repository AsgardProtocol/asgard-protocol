# Asgard Protocol API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Asgard Protocol API documentation. This document provides developers with all the information they need to interact with the Asgard Protocol smart contracts and backend services.

Our API is designed around REST principles. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with an API Key. You can generate an API key from your developer dashboard.

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

## Rate Limiting

The API is rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per user. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
